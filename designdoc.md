# Todo

long - server should re-assign a host to a game when the previous host disconnects and the new host client should reflect that change (buttons, etc.)

? - maybe force phone screen to horizontal to avoid potential display problems?
  - or find another solution
    - maybe adjust the css proportions to take into account screen height and not just width
    
? - set page width/height to device window width/height to prevent unwanted scrolling

? - rework css code to remove bloat

BUG - if a new game is started when one is already running in the server, the first game's clients don't update/get scores!
