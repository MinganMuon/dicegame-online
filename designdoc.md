? - maybe force phone screen to horizontal to avoid potential display problems?
  - or find another solution
    - maybe adjust the css proportions to take into account screen height and not just width
  - now client will remind user to switch to landscape view, but this doesn't fix potential problems with too small of a width to properly view the content
    
? - set page width/height to device window width/height to prevent unwanted scrolling

? - rework css code to remove bloat

? - game runs slow on my phone - investigate this - may just be that my phone is slow

? - ugly dotted line around buttons after they are clicked - fix this
